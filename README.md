# GridsForKids

GridsForKids is a fun lander page for a kids activity catalogue. Using Lottie Player and some crafted animations, it creates a grid of living buttons.

Technically, the page will use the control script to initiliaze an animation cycle, picking 4 different animations to play at random every 5 seconds. All assets and animations scale indefinitely.
